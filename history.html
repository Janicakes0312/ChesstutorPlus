                <b>Medieval Changes</b>: By the late Middle Ages, the game underwent considerable transformation. The pieces began to take on new names and roles; for example, the pieces we now recognize as bishops and queens had different movements and titles.<br>
                <b>Renaissance Developments (15th Century)</b>: The game further evolved during the Renaissance with the introduction of the modern queen, which could move any number of squares. This change made the game faster and more dynamic. The bishop’s movement also changed to allow diagonal movement across any number of squares.<br><br><br>
                <b>Establishing Competitive Play</b><br><br>
                <b>First Tournament (1851)</b>: The first modern chess tournament took place in London, featuring prominent players such as Adolf Anderssen. The tournament’s success established chess as a competitive sport and encouraged future tournaments.<br>
                <b>Official Organizations</b>: The founding of the World Chess Federation (FIDE) in 1924 was crucial in standardizing chess rules and organizing international competitions. FIDE played a significant role in promoting chess worldwide, including the establishment of the World Chess Championship.<br><br><br>
                <b>Notable Matches and Global Popularity</b><br><br>
                <b>World Championship (1972)</b>: The match between American Bobby Fischer and Soviet Boris Spassky was a pivotal moment in chess history, igniting widespread interest in the game during the Cold War era. Fischer's victory not only made him a national hero but also popularized chess in the United States.<br>
                <b>Impact of Technology</b>: The late 20th century saw the rise of computer chess. In 1997, IBM's Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov, marking a significant milestone in artificial intelligence and reshaping how players approach the game.<br><br><br>
                <b>Cultural Significance</b><br>Chess has transcended mere gameplay, influencing literature, art, and philosophy. It symbolizes complex strategies, conflict resolution, and intellectual challenge. Various cultural representations, from paintings to movies, underscore its significance.<br><br><br>
                <b>Modern Era</b><br><br>
                <b>Chess Today</b>: Today, chess remains immensely popular, with millions playing online and participating in local clubs and international tournaments. The rise of streaming platforms has brought a new generation of players to the game, fostering global communities and further enhancing its accessibility.<br>
