            <h2>What is Chess?</h2><br>
            <p1>Chess is a strategic board game played between two players. It takes place on an 8x8 grid called a chessboard, featuring 64 squares of alternating colors. Each player starts with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king, which means putting it in a position where it cannot escape capture.<br><br>
                The game involves deep strategic thinking, tactics, and foresight, with players moving their pieces according to specific rules. Each type of piece has its own unique way of moving. Chess is not only a popular recreational activity but also a competitive sport, with international tournaments and a rich history spanning centuries.</p1>

            <h3>What Are The Chess Pieces? </h3>
            <p2>The chess pieces are what you move on a chessboard when playing a game of chess. There are six different types of chess pieces. Each side starts with 16 pieces: eight <a href="https://www.chess.com/terms/chess-pawn"> pawns</a>, two <a href="https://www.chess.com/terms/chess-bishop"> bishops</a>, two <a href="https://www.chess.com/terms/chess-knight"> knights</a>, two <a href="https://www.chess.com/terms/chess-rook"> rooks</a>, one <a href="https://www.chess.com/terms/chess-queen"> queen</a>, and one <a href="https://www.chess.com/terms/chess-king"> king</a>. Let's meet them! <br><br>
                <b>How The Chess Pieces Move</b><br><br>
                <b>King</b> - Moves one square in any direction.<br>
                <b>Queen</b> -  Moves any number of squares diagonally, horizontally, or vertically.<br>
                <b>Rook</b> -  Moves any number of squares horizontally or vertically.<br>
                <b>Bishop</b> -   Moves any number of squares diagonally.<br>
                <b>Knight</b> -  Moves in an ‘L-shape,’ two squares in a straight direction, and then one square perpendicular to that.<br>
                <b>Pawn</b> -Moves one square forward, but on its first move, it can move two squares forward. It captures diagonally one square forward.<br>
